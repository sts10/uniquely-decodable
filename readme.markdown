# Checks for unique decodability

This repo is an informal collection of implementations of [the Sardinasâ€“Patterson algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sardinas%E2%80%93Patterson_algorithm), which is a test for **unique decodability**.

So far it includes my slow implementation (`src/schlinkert.rs`) and [an implementation by GitHub user @Colfenor](https://github.com/Colfenor/sardinas-patterson), based on [this paper by Micahel Rodeh](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1056535) (`src/colfenor_rodeh.rs`).

I'm hoping to add a large number of tests and sufficient benchmarks soon.
