I'm trying to implement [the Sardinasâ€“Patterson algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sardinas%E2%80%93Patterson_algorithm) myself in Rust. My goal is to be able to determine if a given word list is uniquely decodable or not. 

## Status 

I think this repo's code works, though it's untested and slow. 

However I have since [written what I think is a working implementation in Tidy](https://github.com/sts10/tidy/blob/main/src/display_information/uniquely_decodable.rs).
