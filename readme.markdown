I'm trying to implement [the Sardinasâ€“Patterson algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sardinas%E2%80%93Patterson_algorithm) myself in Rust. My goal is to be able to determine if a given word list is uniquely decodable or not. 

Ultimately I'd like to fold it into [Tidy](https://github.com/sts10/tidy).
